# a pipeline is a set of stuff that will run to implement continuous integration
#    build, test, anything it can do to automatically check the quality of the code.
#   and, maybe also package/publish it, maybe even deploy it to some server or cloud environment like Azure App Service


# every pipeline has a set of conditions deciding when it will activate.
# here we configure: it will run on every push to main branch specifically.
trigger:
- main

# set requirements for the build agent that will run the stuff
# here: ubuntu (latest version) virtual machine
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# set variables, referenced with $() syntax
variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

# the steps to follow. here we have one script step, a command run in bash
# starting from the root folder of the repository.
